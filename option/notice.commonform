\\ In addition, you agree and acknowledge that your rights to any <Shares> underlying this <Option> will vest only as you provide services to the <Company> over time, that the grant of this <Option> is not as consideration for services you rendered to the <Company> prior to your date of hire, and that nothing in this <Notice> or the attached documents confers upon you any right to continue your employment or consulting relationship with the <Company> for any period of time, nor does it interfere in any way with your right of the <Company>'s right to terminate that relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, subject to <Applicable Laws>. Also, to the extent applicable, the <Exercise Price Per Share> has been set in good faith compliance with the applicable guidance issued by the IRS under Section 409A of the <Code>.

You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of such a determination by the IRS. For purposes of this paragraph, the term <Company> will be interpreted to include any <Parent>, <Subsidiary>, or <Affiliate>.

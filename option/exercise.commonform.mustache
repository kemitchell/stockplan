            {{/Veto Right}}
        Notice of Proposed Transfer \\ The Holder of the Shares shall deliver to the Company a written notice (the ""Notice"") stating:
            \\ the Holder's desire to sell or otherwise transfer such Shares;
            \\ the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (""Proposed Transferee"");
            \\ the number of Shares to be transferred to each Proposed Transferee;
            \\ the terms and conditions of each proposed sale or transfer, including (without limitation) the purchase price for such Shares (the ""Purchase Price""); and
            \\ the Holder's offer to the Company or its assignee(s) to purchase the Shares at the Purchase Price and upon the same terms (or terms as similar as reasonably possible).
        Exercise of Right of First Refusal \\  At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the Holder, elect to reject the proposed transfer, in full or in part, or elect to purchase any or all of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees, at the Purchase Price, provided that if the Purchase Price consists of no legal consideration (as, for example, in the case of a transfer by gift), the purchase price will be the fair market value of the Shares as determined in good faith by the Company. If the Purchase Price includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration shall be determined by the Company in good faith.
        Payment \\ Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made, at the election of the Company or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness, or by any combination thereof within 60 days after receipt of the Notice or in the manner and at the times mutually agreed to by the Company (or its assignee(s)) and the Holder.

            \\ not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this Section  and
            \\ approved by the Company to be transferred,
        then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer any unpurchased Shares to the Proposed Transferee at the Purchase Price or at a higher price, provided that such sale or other transfer is consummated within 120 days after the date of the Notice and provided further that any such sale or other transfer is effected in accordance with {{#Transfer Restrictions in Bylaws}}the transfer restrictions set forth in the Company's Bylaws{{/Transfer Restrictions in Bylaws}}{{#Transfer Restrictions in Plan}}, the Plan{{/Transfer Restrictions in Plan}} and any Applicable Laws and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the provisions of this Section  and the waiver of statutory information rights in Section  shall continue to apply to the Shares in the hands of such Proposed Transferee. The Company, in consultation with its legal counsel, may require the Holder to provide an opinion of counsel evidencing compliance with Applicable Laws. If the Shares described in the Notice are not transferred to the Proposed Transferee within such period, or if the Holder proposes to change the price or other terms to make them more favorable to the Proposed Transferee, a new Notice shall be given to the Company, and the Company and/or its assignees shall again have the right to approve such transfer and be offered the Right of First Refusal.

Upon such a transfer, the Holder shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Company of such transfer. The right to purchase such Shares shall be provided to the Company for a period of 30 days following receipt by the Company of written notice from the Holder.

        Termination of Rights \\ The transfer restrictions set forth in Section  {{#Transfer Restrictions in Plan}} and the Plan{{/Transfer Restrictions in Plan}}, the Right of First Refusal granted the Company by Section  and the option to repurchase the Shares in the event of an involuntary transfer granted the Company by Section  shall terminate upon  the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act (other than a registration statement relating solely to the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee incentive or benefit plan) or  any transfer or conversion of Shares made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof is registered under the Exchange Act. Upon termination of such transfer restrictions, the Company will remove any stop-transfer notices referred to in Section  and related to the restrictions in this Section  and a new stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for the Shares not repurchased shall be issued, on request, without the legend referred to in Section  and delivered to Holder.
        Lock-Up Agreement \\ The lock-up provisions set forth in Section  of the Option Agreement shall apply to the Shares issued upon exercise of the Option hereunder and Purchaser reaffirms Purchaser's obligations set forth therein.
        Investment and Taxation Representations \\ In connection with the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser represents to the Company the following:
        Purchaser is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Shares. Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for investment for Purchaser's own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any other person or entity.
        Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed herein.
        Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the securities.
        Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Purchaser understands that the Company provides no assurances as to whether he or she will be able to resell any or all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions. Notwithstanding this Section , Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section .
        Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.
        Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act attached as {Rule 506 Excerpt}.
        Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser's purchase or disposition of the Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.
        Voting Provisions. As a condition precedent to entering into this Agreement, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall become a party to any voting agreement to which the Company is a party at the time of Purchaser's execution and delivery of this Agreement, as such voting agreement may be thereafter amended from time to time (the ""Voting Agreement""), by executing an adoption agreement or counterpart signature page agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of the Voting Agreement and to vote the Shares in the capacity of a "Common Holder" and a "Stockholder" as such terms may be defined in the Voting Agreement.
